## Introduction

dottoc is a C# library for interfacing with the (defunct) TOC servers for AOL Instant Messenger. This library was originally hosted on SourceForge, then Google Code and now it is kept on GitHub for posterity.

Originally the library supported TOC, then eventually TOC2, until 2012 when AOL ended support for the TOC protocol.
